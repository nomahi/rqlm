## Bias Correction and Improved Robust Variance Estimation for the Modified Poisson and Least-Squares Regression Analyses

Modified Poisson and least-squares regression analyses have been standard multivariate analysis methods to estimate risk ratio and risk difference in clinical and epidemiological studies. However, the ordinary robust variance estimator possibly has serious bias under small or moderate sample size situations. Also, the risk ratio estimator has bias under small sample settings. This package provides computational tools of their bias correction and improved robust variance estimators (Noma, 2024+). Bias-corrected risk ratio estimator and improved confidence intervals are available for these regression methods.
