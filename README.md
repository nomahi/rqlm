## Modified Poisson and least-squares regression analyses with improved robust variance estimators

Modified Poisson and least-squares regression analyses have been standard multivariate analysis methods to estimate risk ratio and risk difference in clinical and epidemiological studies. However, the ordinary robust variance estimator possibly has serious bias under small or moderate sample size situations. This package provides computational tools of their improved robust variance estimators (Noma, 2024+). Also, the Pan-Wall-type t-approximation of sample distributions are available for calculating confidence interval and P-value.
