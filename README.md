## Statistical Analysis Tools of the Modified Poisson and Least-Squares Regression Analyses for Binary Outcomes

Modified Poisson and least-squares regression analyses for binary outcomes have been standard multivariate analysis methods to estimate risk ratio and risk difference in clinical and epidemiological studies. This R package involves an easy-to-handle function to implement these analyses by simple commands. Also, recent studies have shown the ordinary robust variance estimator possibly has serious bias under small or moderate sample size situations for these methods. This package also provides computational tools to calculate alternative accurate confidence intervals (Noma et al., 2024+).
